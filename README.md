# :computer: CODE - C
This repository is a collection of libraries for programming in <b>C</b>.
<br>
Every library works as a template, but since in pure C there are no templates, for each type you want to use the library with, it must be used a unic <i>'library.c'</i> file. 
More instruction will be given in the single <i>'library.h'</i> file.
<br>
<br>
## :question: How to use the repo
The repo is diveded in subfolders, wich contains the code scripts:<br>
